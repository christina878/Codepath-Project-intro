    <h2>Impact!</h2>

    <img src="Image/ii.jpg" />
    <h3> People at TEENAGERS</h3>
    <p class="important"> Acne is most common in teenagers because of the hormonal changes that occur during puberty.
      During puberty, the body produces more of the hormones testosterone and androgen. These hormones stimulate the
      sebaceous glands in the skin to produce more sebum, an oily substance that helps to protect and lubricate the
      skin.
    </p>

    <h3> People at MIDDLE AGE</h3>
    <p class="important">Hormones: Acne is caused by hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty,
      menstruation, and pregnancy.

        <h3>Acne: Overview
      </a>
      <h4>Severe acne: People who have severe forms of acne have a lot of papules and pustules, as well as nodules on
        their skin. Acne mostly develops on areas of skin that have more oil glands, like the face, chest, back and
        shoulders. The main reason teenagers get acne is because their bodies make more androgen hormones during
        puberty. A number of scientific studies have looked into the effect of diet on acne, but they mostly didn't find
        any connection between what people eat and the likelihood of developing acne. People with acne often try out
        different things to improve the appearance of their skin.</h4>
